# VSS-Dataset
The first dataset for implementing the "Voice-Song Suitability Analysis" (VSSA) task, currently only contains the dataset annotation file.

We used song audio from the MERGE dataset to pair vocal audio from the GTSinger and SingStyle111 datasets, annotating the matching scores. Please download the audio data yourself.

The annotation file contains the style and emotion labels of the songs, as well as the timbre and singing technique labels of the songs.

SingStyle111 requires your own application.
